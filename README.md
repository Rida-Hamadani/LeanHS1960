# Hoffman-Singleton Theorem

The purpose of this repository is to formally prove the Hoffman-Singleton theorem.

> [!WARNING]
> The proof still has some `sorry`s. PRs are welcome!

## Why?

If the question is "why formalize?", refer to [this](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~patrick.massot/files/exposition/why_formalize.pdf) [^1]. If the question is "why formalize the Hoffman-Singleton theorem?", then the reasons are:

- It is often used as an example in books related to combinatorics [^2] [^3].
- An unsolved problem is related [^4].
- I'm interested in formalizing a proof that uses multiple areas of math.
- It is a beautiful result!
